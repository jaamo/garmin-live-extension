# Garmin Live extension

![Totals page](screenshot.png "Screenshot")

This is a very bespoke Chrome extension which captures distance information from Garmin Live tracking from multiple tabs and displays the total sum distance in results screen.

The extension is made for Team Rynkeby Tampere for their indoor cycling promotion in February 2018. The idea was to use four indoor trainers in shopping mall to cycle the same distance they did last year's Team Rynkeby (roughly 1400 km in total).

Each bike has Garmin cycling computer on it. Activity is live tracked on Garmin Connect and this extension collects distances and displays total travelled distance.

NOTE: This extension is not made to use in everyday life. Better to keep it disabled / uninstalled when not in the event :) Extension is not available on Google Web Store.
