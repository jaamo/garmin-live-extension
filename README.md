# Garmin Live extension

This is a very bespoke Chrome extension which captures distance information from Garmin Live tracking from multiple tabs and displays the total sum distance in results screen.

The extension is made for cycling club Kaupin Kanuunat for their Team Rynkeby indoor cycling promotion in February 2018. The idea was to use four indoor trainers in shopping mall to cycle the same distance they did last year's Team Rynkeby (roughly 1600 km in total).

Each bike has Garmin cycling computer on it. Activity is live tracked on Garmin Connect and this extension collects distances and displays total travelled distance.

NOTE: This extension is not made to use in everyday life. Better to keep it disabled / uninstalled when not in the event :)

## How to use

* Install extension
* Open Garmin live tracking pages. The extension should start capturing distances automatically. 
* Click the extension icon on the address bar to open totals page.

## Troubleshooting

Open Inspector and Console tab on Garmin Live page. You should see the total printed to the console.
